# PRODIGY_CS_04
This project is the fourth task for the Prodigy InfoTech Python Programming Internship. It involves developing a simple keylogger in Python that captures and logs all keystrokes made by the user. The primary function of this tool is to monitor keyboard activity and store the pressed keys into a log file for analysis. The program typically runs in the background and records user input in real-time, making it useful for controlled experiments, parental monitoring, or educational demonstrations about cybersecurity risks. The implementation uses libraries such as pynput for listening to keyboard events and Python file handling for storing the logs. A key focus of this task is understanding the ethical implications and ensuring the tool is only used with proper permissions and consent. It reinforces knowledge of event handling, file operations, and user privacy, highlighting how powerful features in programming must be used responsibly.
